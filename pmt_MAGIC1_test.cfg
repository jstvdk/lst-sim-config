% This has no direct implications on the analog (discriminator) and digitized

gain_variation = 0.0 % random gain variation

% since we do not simulate the HV variations, the total transit time will likely only shift the position of the pulses (?)

% MAGIC simulations use 0.66 ns single phe time jitter (sigma of a Gausian), but
% there is another component in M1 from chessboarding: binomial distribution with 0.6 ns separation
% the latter one corresponds to a sigma of 0.3, so the total spread is sqrt(0.66^2 + 0.3^2) = 0.725
